# Weather-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis or sometimes referred to as exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the core components of data science. It is also the part on the majority of the time which makes it extremely important in the field of data science. This repository demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis methods and techniques using Python. The purpose of the used Weather dataset has been taken from Kaggle since it is one of the ideal dataset for performing EDA and taking a step towards the most amazing and interesting field of data science. Good luck with your EDA on the used Weather dataset.
# Project Description
Performed Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn Libraries. Find and Fill Null Values. 
Data visualization is used to understand the data for the purpose.
Improved the ability to understand the weather condition.

# Conclusion :-
Checked Null Values.
Shown the weather condition was exactly Clear.
Wind speed was exactly 7.
Top 10 Hottest temprature values and there counts . 
Renamed Weather column to weather condition . 
Shown weather condtion through visualization .
